Shiro does not store any data except Discord IDs(Snowflakes) in it's database. 
Public messages, DMs, usernames, statistics are not saved in any form. 

Shiro provides such functionality, so deleted or edited messages be logged publicly or privately in a guild channel. That functionality is refered in the "help" as chatlogging.
Shiro provides guild based warnlogs. Warnlogs save information about the type of warn (ban, kick, mute, etc), a reason and your Discord ID.
